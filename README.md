DogDates is an App for dog owners who want to schedule playdates for their furry friends. It is also my capstone project for the [Neue Fische](https://www.neuefische.de/) Web Development Bootcamp.

## Getting Started

To run locally, run the development server and install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Now you should be able to run it on your own device.

## About DogDates

DogDates helps you plan playdates for your dog and its friends. In order to schedule a date and share it with other dog owners, you can add a new meeting. Select a location and fill in the form with more information about date, time and your dogs preferences. Let people know whether your dog is compatible with their pup. You can also add a profile for your dog and edit it whenver needed.
